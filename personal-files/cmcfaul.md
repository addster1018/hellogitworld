# cmcfaul: Colin McFaul

My name is Colin McFaul. I live in New Orleans.
TODO list for April 2015:
- [x] Defend my dissertation
- [x] attend Github workshop
- [ ] submit my dissertation paperwork

My favorite restaurant in New Orleans is [Commander's Palace](http://www.commanderspalace.com/). I especially like their Sunday Jazz Brunch. They have $0.50 martinis with weekday lunch, but I haven't been.

I also like [Mat and Nadde's](http://www.matandnaddies.com/)
